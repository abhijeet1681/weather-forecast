WEATHER-APP : HTML, CSS and JavaScript
------------------------------------------------------

The weather app created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides real-time weather information for a user-selected location. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, with a clean and modern layout.

The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data, including current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and clouds. The app also includes a search bar where users can enter the name of their desired location or use their device's geolocation to automatically detect their current location.
